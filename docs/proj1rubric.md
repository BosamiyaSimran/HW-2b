|What | Notes|evidence|score 0..4<br>(0=no, 2=ok, 4=wow!)|
|-----|------|------|--------|
|Misc | Group members attended group sessions|show meeting logs||
|Distrbuted dev model: | decisions made by unanmyous vote||
|| group meetings had a round robin speaking order||
|| group meetings had a moderator that managed the round robin| meeting  logs list the moderator||
|| group meeting moderator rotated among  the group||
|| code conforms to some packaging standard|github issue  reports with a checklist of package features, checked off||
|| code has can be downloaded from some standard package manager|url given||
| |workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence  in GH||
|| Number of commits|in GH||
|| Number of commits: by different people|in GH||
|| Issues reports: there are **many**|||
||  issues are being  closed|evidence in GH||
|| License: exists|in GH||
|| DOI badge: exists |in GH||
||Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |in GH||
||Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |||
||Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries||
||Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|||
||Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|||
|| (hard) code conforms to some known patterns ||
|Tools Matter| Use of version control tools|||
|| Extensive use of version control tools |||
|| Repo has an up-to-date requirements.txt file|||
|| Repo does not have "ignore" files.|||
||Use of  style checkers |config files in GH showing your config||
||Extensive Use of  style checkers |issue reports showing team fixing errors found  in  this way||
|| Use of code  formatters. |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config||
|| Extensive Use of code  formatters. |issue  reports showing team fixing errors found in  this  way||
|| Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  ||
|| Extensive use of syntax checkers. |issue reports showing your team fixing errors found in this way||
|| Use of code coverage |config files in GH||
|| Extensive use of code coverage |issue reports showing you  team fixing errors found  in this  way||
|| other automated analysis tools|||
|| Extensive use of  other automated analysis tools|ssue reports showing you  team fixing errors found  in this  way||
|| test cases exist|and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base||
|| test cases are routinely executed|||
| consensus-oriented model| the files CONTRIBUTING.md and CODEOFCONDUCT.md has have multiple edits by multiple people|||
| | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|||
| | multiple people contribute to discussions|||
|| issues are discussed before they are closed|||
|| Chat channel: exists|||
|| Chat channel: is active |||
|| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|||
| zero internal boundaries | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|||
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|||
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|||
| | evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|||
| low-regressions rule | (hard to judge) features released are not subsequently removed|||
|short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|||
