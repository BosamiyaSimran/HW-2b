# Homework 2: Practice on a real packet 


Following the previous assignment, in this one we will:
  
- Read some most recent cutting-edge papers in the SE community
- Find reused works in those papers
- Submit the reuse report in the required format just like in HW 1

## What to do
1. We will assign you a package! Please go to assigning sheet (announce later) and find your working package.
  
2. In the Reuse GitHub Repo: https://github.com/bhermann/DoR, find the **issue** corresponds to your working package. In that **issue**, leave the comment "I would like to work on this please!". GitHub action will automatically assign you to this issue.
  
3. Now in the homepage of that repo, please grab your packet from the [todo list](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/tree/main/workflow/todo) 
  
4. Same as Homework 1, please find the reuse in your package by following the [standard instruction](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md)
  
5. Report the reuse in a .csv file.
 
  
## What to submit

- Prepare your DOR report in the required format (see the [sample csv](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/results-sample.csv))
- Name your report csv file **wp-XX-results.csv** (where XX refers to the work package id like "ae").
- Upload you report file following the [standard instruction](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md).
- After you upload your csv file, leave comment "I completed this work package.". The GitHub action will automatically unassign you to that issue.
- In the central spreadsheet XXX, paste the link of the issue you worked on (under the column `link to result`).
