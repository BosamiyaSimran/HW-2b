# History

Warning the following timeline might be wrong 
&plusmn; 5 years.
And if some trend is  big  in one decade,
then you know that was the result
of years of prior engineering.


## 1950s: Working it out from  Scratch

"For some years I have been successfully 
using the following rule of thumb for 
scheduling a software task:

- l/3 planning
- l/6 coding
- l/4 component test and early system test 
-  l/4 system test, all components in hand."

Pay attention: half of development is testing.

## 1970s: Personnel

Alan Kay: the best way to predict the future is to invent it.

- If you want to see what he meant: [Microelectronics and the Personal Computer](http://mnielsen.github.io/notes/kay/micro.pdf) Alan C. Kay Scientific
American Vol. 237, No. 3 (September 1977), pp. 230-245

"The user makes his primary input through a typewriterlike keyboard
and a pointing device called a moise which controls the position
of an arrow on the screen."

"WINDOWS" dislay frames within the  larger display screen, emable
the user or organie  and  edit information at several levesl  of
refinement.

## 1990s: Connections (Welcome to the Internet)

- Internet, 
- Open Source; e.g. see 
  [Shares of Linux Firm Red Hat More Than Triple After IPO](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB934376738897331391)
- [Internet Bubble](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/dotcom-bubble/):
  1995 to 2001, massive price rises in Internet  stocks. Then...
  - "The bursting of the bubble caused market panic through massive 
      sell-offs of dotcom company stocks, driving their values further down, 
    and by 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion."

## 2010: Mobile

Welcome to the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy).

The age is (myth)misinformation. Information, weaponized.

## 2020: AI

AI, autonomous vechicles.

?? Blockchain

- Ezra Klein, NY Times,  Aug 12, 2021:
  - If the original internet let you easily copy information, 
    the next internet will let you easily trade ownership of digital goods. 
  - Crypto lets you make digital goods scarce, which increases their value; 
    it lets you prove ownership, which allows you to buy and sell them; 
    and it makes digital identities verifiable, as that’s merely information you own
  - Together, they unlock the potential for a true economy for digital goods, 
    where creators actually get rewarded for what they make. I will admit to some skepticism that this is how it’ll play out, as many of the financiers funding crypto also founded and sit on the boards of the companies that set the terms of today’s internet, but we’ll see.
