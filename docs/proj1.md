# Project 1

Goal1: start something that another groups will say
"yes, for Project2, we want to finish that".

Goal2: (much harder) start something  another groups will say
"yes, for Project3, we know how to evaluate if that does something
better than something else".

## Start by Picking  a Project

(Hint: do it now!)

Pick something. Code it in any language using any tools you like. But

- everyone on the team has to use the same tools
- all the work has to be shared via Github (public repos, 
  general GH-- not NCSU):

What to do? Well pick something:

- Cool: 
  - Cause you have to impress;
- Not ambitious:
  - So you can make significant progress in 4 weeks;
- Not too small: 
  - So you can  impress people with the work;
- Small enough:
  - So you can finish;
- Where there is something already running:
  - So you get going fast;
- Something the whole team can contribute to
  - Work in  a language that everyone in the team can handle:
  - Work on a problem everyone can understand

If you want to be in the running for "projects
that survivie into the next round"
your system has to do something better then something else.

- Which means your code has to address some problem in some current system
- And do so in a manner that is quantifiable.

## Grading

Your work will be assessed via how many of the 
<a href="https://go.pardot.com/l/6342/2017-10-24/3xr3f2/6342/188781/Publication_LinuxKernelReport_2017.pdf">Linux Kernel Best Practices</a>
 (see pages 25,26)
you can emulate.

Note: complete this table and add to the root of your project in a file called _PROJ1-selfAssessment.md_.

Total score: 
- write down "4" into every right-hand-side cell
- Look for evidence that any "4" should be something else
- sum the right-hand-column, divide by number of rows
