## Build an  AI.  Build it better 

better = faster, generalizable, simpler, explicable, fairer

background:

- cut the  crap
    - so much on  fairness, so much that is needless confusion
    - cut the  crap1: suvodeep's survey
    - cut the crap2: don't  say  explain, say abduct
    - cut the crap3: keys. many systems  controlled by just a few
- keys (things are simple, in theory
- keys.lua (things re simple, in practice)

theory:

- entropy, variance
- less than  ( &lt;, bdom, code effect  size, bootstrap)
    -   NGSGA-II: a patch  on bdom 
- multiobjectie optimization. sa, ga, local search, de, pareto, decomposition# sin21
